# Reaping

_Harvest your animals in the most cursed way possible._

By using the Reaper you can harvest food from animals as if you had killed them, but without the guilt of killing them -
the reaper tool simply cuts off most of the animal, making them a child again - **science!**

## Features

- Obtain 4 types of reaper, the _Iron Reaper_, the _Gold Reaper_, the _Diamond Reaper_, and the _Netherite Reaper_. The
  sharpness and cooldown system means each has its own benefits and drawbacks!
- Reap animals to turn them into babies and drop meat; reap babies to kill them and drop bones!
- Reap players or villagers to drop _Suspicious Meat_ and make them small!
- Put a reaper in a dispenser to automate your crimes!
- Fight a new kind of pillager, who carries a reaper and will reap any villagers it finds during a raid!
- Enjoy our compatibility with other mods such as _Harvest Scythes_.
